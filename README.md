# PROJECT-FANET

Like every other engineer on the planet, I too have had(and continue to have) my phase of fascination with robots.
Let's face it though! Robots are friggin cool!
What's cooler than a robot? Maybe, a drone....

I mean, a robot that flies is "gonnsta" be awesome!

But give the robot router-like functionalities and loads of friends to chat to, and the future of the Internet is here!

That's the dream! 
Here's to investigating swarm robotics, networking, aerodynamics and God knows what else, as my friend Sudiksha and I create a FANET, that 
will one day revolutionize the Internet as we know it!

Here's (also) to over-ambition, confidence and the fiery engineering passion that fuels innovation....

Footnote:
The Internet is a miraculous delight that has transformed my life for the better. I will go above and beyond when I say that the Internet 
must be declared a fundamental right. The power of collaboration that it brings, gives me hope for a better, brighter and awesomer future.

With this project, I hope to explore and research novel ways of providing Internet to the world in a manner that is cost-effective.
Setting up network infrastructure is tough, especially in non-planar terrains. This project is my first step into the exploration of a 
better way of networking and getting the world a lot more closer, together vis-a vis a FANET
